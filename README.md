#Biglide_simulation ROS2

Simulated the Biglide mechanism using ROS2, focusing on  control, and trajectory tracking in a simulated environment. Developed in parallel with other coursework projects.

#C++ Projects

A collection of C++ projects that explore algorithm development, enhancing C++ proficiency through practical exercises. Part of a series of parallel projects during coursework.

#Pick and Place with Delmia

Designed and simulated a pick-and-place robotic operation for SCARA robot in Delmia, covering path planning, kinematics, and collision avoidance within a virtual manufacturing environment.

Manipulator Modeling

Implemented the Kinematics and Inverse kinematics through the DH parameters for Kr16,UR10 & Turret robot and  . Worked on this project alongside other coursework activities.

#OpenCV Python

Implemented computer vision tasks in Python using OpenCV, including image processing, object detection, and basic machine learning techniques for vision-based applications.
